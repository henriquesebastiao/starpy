## How to install the CLI

To install the cli, I recommend using pipx:

<div class="termy">

```console
$ pipx install starpy
---> 100%
installed package <strong>starpy {{variables.version}}</strong>, installed using Python 3.11
These apps are now globally available
  - starpy
done! âœ¨ ðŸŒŸ âœ¨
```

</div>

But anyway, this is just a recommendation. You can also install using the manager you prefer. Like pip:

```bash
pip install starpy
```
